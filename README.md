## Before Getting Started

Make sure that you have both [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on the computer that you are running this app on (Note: `git` will be used to install this repository, and `Node.js` comes with the Node Package Manager `npm` which will be used to install this app's dependencies and run the app locally).

## Running This App Locally

### Steps:

1. Change your current working directory to the directory where you would like to clone this repository.

- `cd directory/for/this/repository`

2. Clone this repository.

- `git clone https://github.com/garciaj92/vimeo.git`

3. Change your current working directory to the project's directory.

- `cd vimeo`

4. In the project directory install all of the dependencies required to run the app.

- `npm install`

5. Still in the project directory, you can run the program locally by running:

- `npm start`

6. The previous step should open your default browser and the app should be running. In the case that this did not happen automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.
